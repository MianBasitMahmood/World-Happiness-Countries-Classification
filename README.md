 Machine Learning and Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique for 
reducing data dimensionality and converting correlated to 
uncorrelated properties. The goal is to conduct a statistical study 
of data from the World Happiness Report and how it relates to 
nations' economic income, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as well 
as to discover additional variables that impact happiness. The 
method employs research methods and Machine Learning 
techniques to create models that describe the function used to 
forecast a country's happiness score. Two different machine 
learning methods will be tested and compared
